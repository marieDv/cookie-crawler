    <h2>The After Monument<br></h2><br>
    In the fall of 2020 our tutors in the Information Design Masters program at Design Academy Eindhoven proposed a
    loosely collective project focused on the widespread protests in the summer of 2020, in particular the removal of
    figures memorialized for their roles in racist and colonial activities. Dozens of monuments were removed--mostly
    Confederate figures--in the United States, some by force, others by local governments. In Europe, the pulling down
    of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK by protesters and the removal of King Leopold II by Antwerp city
    officials made international news. <br><br>While this project began as an assignment, our class felt that these
    monuments tell a richer narrative in combination rather than in isolation. This planted the seed for a collaborative
    website designed and built intentionally from the ground, up.&nbsp; This website was built with only open-source
    tools and fonts.&nbsp; The underlying code infrastructure was designed and built so that every designer, regardless
    of prior technical knowledge, would be able to code their own page. <br><br>As one of the team leaders in this
    project, I was responsible for organisation and the technical aspects of the website. The main challenge lay in the
    planning and execution of a system of web components that could be re-used across the website’s various pages and be
    implemented by designers without any prior coding experience. To achieve this goal, I organized various workshops
    and talks to explain basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the other students. Together with 4 of my classmates: Vitor
    Ferreira Serra, Anda Lupascu, Marina Menéndez-Pidal and Maxine Oosterholt, we created a complex system of over 40
    different web components and four templates.<br>
    <br>Our class became very passionate about the project, the collection of individual stories and the design and
    development of the page. Eventually the project started a discussion that far exceeded our expectations and has been
    presented in form of a panel discussion at the Dutch Design Week 2021 in Eindhoven, N
